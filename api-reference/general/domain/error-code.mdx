Go54 uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, user is not unauthorized, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error from the server.
