Our API follows a well-defined structure with clear paths and endpoints for easy navigation and interaction. This section provides an overview of the API's structure and how to use it effectively.

### Base URL

- Staging: https://staging.go54.com/v1
- Live: https://api.go54.com/v1

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

| API Area | API Endpoint                          | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Domain   | [base_url]/domain                     | Register, transfer and update domain  |
